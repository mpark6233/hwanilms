(and more), while keeping every legacy behavior (e.g., class:foo, placeholder:Enter_name, 40/255 size syntax) fully backward-compatible and safe.  (11.0.2)
	* **NEW** Quoted attributes anywhere in the shortcode:  [text firstname class="someCSSclass otherclass" placeholder="First name" maxlength="64" "John"]  (11.0.2)
	* **NEW** Selects / radios / checkboxes accept quoted classes and other safe attributes: [selectbox country class:"wide" size="6" include_blank "Unated States@@US" "France@@FR"]
	* **NEW** Booleans preserved: multiple still works (legacy token) and also via multiple="" or multiple="multiple".
	* **NEW** Defaults remain last quoted values: by removing quoted attribute values from the “values” bucket, we guarantee back-compat with your “defaults come last” rule.
	* **NEW** Legacy behavior untouched: id:foo, class:bar, placeholder:Enter_name, and 40/255 still work and take sensible precedence.
	* **NEW** Safety: we allow a conservative set of attributes, block style, and escape all values with esc_attr. aria-* and data-* are permitted.
 	* **Improvement**: Added support for quoted placeholders in booking form shortcodes. You can now specify placeholders with spaces directly in quotes inside the form shortcode. For example: [text name placeholder:"Enter first name" "John"] This makes it easier to use multi-word placeholders without underscores. The old syntax (placeholder:Enter_first_name) still works for backward compatibility.
